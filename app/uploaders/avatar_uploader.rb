  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  storage :fog

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:

    asset_path [version_name, "avatar_default.gif"].compact.join '_'

  # Process files as they are uploaded:

  version :thumbnail do
    process resize_to_fill: [128, 128]
  end

  version :inline do
    process resize_to_fill: [18, 18]
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  # def extension_white_list
  #   %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  # end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # def filename
  #   "something.jpg" if original_filename
